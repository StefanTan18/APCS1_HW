Response to
Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
Test ideas by experiment and observations.
Build on those ideas that pass the test.
Reject the ones that fail.
Follow the evidence wherever it leads and question everything.
Is our cosmic address almost like subclasses of each other?
COSMOS MUST BE INFINITE!
Bruno kept trying even though no one actually believed him.
It was very dangerous for him voice his views as they went against
the Church.
Once the idea was known, it gave others a target to aim at.
The Cosmic Calender is used to put the birth of the universe relative to
a scale we could understand.
A small difference such as a nudging of an asteroid, could cause a
huge impact like the dinosaurs still being alive and maybe even humans
not even existing.

Response to
Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
@-------------------------------------------------
We use the gift of recognizing patterns to read the calender
in the sky.
We used the sky to tell our ancestors what to do like when to migrate.
Comets were signs of disaster for almost every civilization back then.
Our ability to recognize patterns is a double-edged sword.
"See for yourself" -----> QUESTION AUTHORITY
The coffeehouse allowed the transfer of ideas no matter the class of the
person.
Newton was afraid that Robert Hooke would steal his ideas again.
Without Halley, Newton's ideas would have never been concieved.
All stars in motion.
Scientists have used these Newton's laws to this day.
